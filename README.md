## Introduction
 **Parserud** is a handy script for parsing selective data from any _udacity_ course front page, and making a markdown file with it for note taking during the course. It will surely save you some time if you wanted to have a _note taking template_ for _udacity_ courses.

## How To Use
 Provide the udacity course url as comamnd line argument.
 `python3 parserud.py https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123`

 It will parse from the course url and create a markdown file named after _course title_.

## Notes
 It will not work for all types of course pages, I will try to patch for those someday.
